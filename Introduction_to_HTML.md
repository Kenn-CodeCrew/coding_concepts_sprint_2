# Introduction to HTML
HTML (**H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

## HTML Concepts
HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:

`My cat is very grumpy`

If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:

`<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>`

As far as it's relationship to the other key technologies of [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is often described as 1 of 3 in the triad of core web development technologies. 

It is often useful to think about the 3 complimenting technologies as a noun-adjective-verb relationship.

* The Noun HTML - HTML is the what, such as a paragraph
* The Adjective CSS - CSS defines the characteristics about the HTML content such as is **bold**
* The Verb JavaScript - JavaScript defines actions about the HTML such as 'hide this paragraph' or 'show' the form when the user clicks a button
