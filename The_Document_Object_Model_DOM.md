# The Document Object Model (DOM)

## What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model is a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The document can be further processed and the results of that processing can be incorporated back into the presented page. This is an overview of DOM-related materials here at W3C and around the web.

The HTML you write is parsed by the browser and turned into the DOM. But your HTML is not the DOM.
